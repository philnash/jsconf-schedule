            <p>Games in the 80s and 90s redefined the relationship between a user and a computer. Realtime, offline-first networking, fluid graphics, and physics-based animations posed incredible development challenges. Overcoming these challenges introduced a whole class of elegant techniques for immersive user experiences - that most JavaScript developers have never heard of!</p>

            <p>My talk will show that normal JS apps will soon rely on game programming techniques every day. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at how many libraries you&rsquo;re using are already based on basic game-loop architecture. Finally, you&rsquo;ll leave ready to push your own apps forward with a little bit of gaming magic.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>When I became a developer evangelist in early 2012, I was told that an important part of my job was to support my developer community. This open ended mandate was both scary and exciting and I threw myself into the role, eventually getting involved in organizing meetups, hackathons, conferences and even a coworking space in my adopted home of Seattle, WA. However, earlier this year I started to experience severe burnout related to these activities and as I spoke to other organizers I started to hear similar stories. The number of developers worldwide is growing at a breakneck pace and we need many more people to jump in and help support the new members of our community. This talk is about the joys of getting involved but also how the things that you love can sometimes hurt you. I&rsquo;d like to share a few things I learned recently about prioritizing people over projects that make contributing both more scalable and also much more rewarding.</p>

          <h3>Michael Poltorak Nielsen - Alternative Smartphone Interactions based on Sensor Data</h3>
          <p><time>11:15</time> Side Track</p>
          <div class="description">
            <p>This is a talk about alternative ways to interact with smartphones and tablets.</p>

            <p>Being equipped with an array of sensors (touch screen, GPS, camera, proximity sensor, gyroscopes, compass, microphone, accelerometer, and even a humitiy sensor), smartphones and tablets offer a whole new range of input options.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ll talk about how these new inputs can help improve and augment the current keyboard and swipe/pinch interaction paradigm. I&rsquo;ll give examples of how the new interaction types can be implemented (some at a conceptual level, others more concrete). Demo-wise, I&rsquo;ll also show you how a real-life search engine can be augmented for smartphone use.</p>

            <p>In addition, I&rsquo;ll show you how data from many of the sensors are accessible directly from Javascript and give some pointers to how to transform the raw data into more structured web app consumable input.</p>

            <p>Overall, my talk is about how to move away from a text input based paradigm and how to establish new ways of interaction better suited to the new devices on their own terms. </p>

            <p>This presentation explains the various ways in which JavaScript relies on Unicode, what the consequences are for JavaScript developers, and how ECMAScript 6 will make our lives a bit easier in this regard.</p>

            <p>First off, the basics of Unicode are explained. Once that&rsquo;s out of the way, I&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about different character encodings, only to determine the character encoding that JavaScript uses internally.</p>

            <p>Then we&rsquo;ll explore the various consequences of JavaScript exposing &ldquo;characters&rdquo; according to UCS-2/UTF-16, and I&rsquo;ll explain why it can be problematic.</p>

            <p>Finally, I&rsquo;ll present robust ECMAScript 5-compatible workarounds to the issues encountered, and explain how ECMAScript 6 will make it easier to support full Unicode in JavaScript strings and regular expressions.</p>

            You&rsquo;re finishing up the final bugs for your guaranteed AppStore hit, Asteroids: Totally Different This Time. Just before release, your crazy game designer partner has an epiphany: &ldquo;What if… What if <em>you</em> were the asteroids, instead of the ship!? It will subvert the player&rsquo;s every expectation since the dawn of gaming!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Another programmer might despair: the glorious, deep and wide inheritance tree, ruined! The entire code architecture was founded on the player controlling just the ship!</p>

            <p>But instead of despair, you remember that you focused more on the data and the systems that operate on that data, and are able to turn around the new version overnight.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>JavaScript is the lingua franca of the web, yet it remains predominantly sequential and web applications until recently have been unable to utilize hardware parallelism. The goal of Parallel JavaScript is to change that. Parallel JavaScript provides web developers with a safe, high-level API that allows them to write applications that effectively utilize multi-core and SIMD parallelism as well as GPUs while preserving the programmability and portability of JavaScript. This talk will introduce the key design principles of Parallel JavaScript, the API itself and our experiences with implementing it. Finally I will show sample applications that highlight the leaps in performance that are possible. I will also briefly discuss the standardization efforts underway to make Parallel JavaScript part of ECMAScript 7.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>On July 21st, 2007, 15 million people around the world took a break from their daily routine to read the final installment of J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s best-selling Harry Potter series. Through this spellbinding story, Rowling crafted a global phenomenon, outselling every book in history with the exception of the Bible and Mao Zedong&rsquo;s Little Red Book.  What can the Harry Potter phenomenon, which was largely fueled by the Internet, teach us about JavaScript? More than you might think. </p>

            <p>In my talk, I&rsquo;ll highlight some similarities between the adoption of Harry Potter and JavaScript. The spread of both HP and JavaScript occurred at the same time in the late 90s, and each phenomenon had a role in shaping the other. I&rsquo;ll also discuss how the magic of Harry Potter and its international fan following can inform the global JavaScript community. After the talk, you&rsquo;ll understand the evolution of JavaScript from an entirely new perspective and you&rsquo;ll be exposed to a few magical JavaScript APIs.</p>

            <p>Scaling Node applications from prototyping stacks to production can be very difficult as there is a big lack of conventions and best practices that work across companies and even communities. In this talk Tim will be showcasing his favourite 4 modules of KrakenJS – a thin convention layer on top of Express – which helped PayPal pushing out Node apps. Learn some key findings that PayPal made when working on Node and how we structured the introduction of it into our existing infrastructure. Being more efficient, needing less people working on projects and being way more responsive than classical apps Node and Kraken have become PayPal&rsquo;s favourite stack.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>We often talk about JavaScript as a ‘functional programming language&rsquo;. This is mostly because it has first-class functions, but there is far more to functional programming than that. Immutable data, recursion, laziness, type systems and sophisticated static analysis are all tools in the functional programmer&rsquo;s box.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, many of those tools are regarded as impractical, academic concepts of no use to real-world software engineers. But as you&rsquo;ll find out, they&rsquo;re based on quite simple ideas and you&rsquo;re already using a few of them – you just don&rsquo;t know it yet. And the ones you&rsquo;re not using might inspire you to look at programming differently.</p>

            <p>By consciously paying attention to these techniques, we can make our programs easier to understand, test and change, and we can even use them to make our computers solve more of our problems for us.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>Data compression is an amazing topic. Even in today&rsquo;s world, with fast networks and almost unlimited storage, data compression is still relevant, especially for mobile devices and countries with poor Internet connections. </p>

            <p>For better or worse, GZIP compression is the de-facto lossless compression method for compressing text data in websites. It is not the fastest nor the better, but provides an excellent tradeoff between speed and compression ratio. The way Internet works makes it also difficult to use newer compression methods.</p>

            <p>This talk examines how GZIP works internally, explaining the internals of the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. Different implementations will be compared, such as GNU GZIP, 7-ZIP and zopfli, focusing on why and how some of these implementations perform better than others. </p>

            <p>Finally, we will try to go beyond GZIP, preprocessing our data to achieve better results. For example, transposing JSON.</p>

            <p>Don&rsquo;t tell your boss, but I want you to make a useless art project–because it&rsquo;s actually pretty useful. Why? Committing to uselessness is a freeing experiment. As professionals, we tend to focus on the end result instead of the process, and that&rsquo;s not healthy. Embrace the creative process (iteration and experimentation) on a project and see where the path takes you.</p>

            <p>On the plus side, air crashes are the most well-investigated complex systems failures, and the lessons learned from these can be reapplied to coping with failure when it happens in the complex systems we build.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>2013 and 2014 has seen the rise of JavaScript parsers that generate a consumable AST (such as Esprima or Acorn) and static analysis tools that operate on that AST (eslint, esmangle, or escodegen, or graspjs). These tools all operate on the structure of JS but have to rely on the AST node type or full name to modify the underlying code. With type information, static analysis and refactoring tools could be made more powerful by being able to accurately refer to any JavaScript statement in the codebase.</p>

            <p>In this talk I&rsquo;ll show how to use declared and inferred type information to make JavaScript safer to use at scale (think prevent XSS) and how to use simple JavaScript templates to apply complex automated refactorings in minutes throughout extremely large code bases.</p>

On our way, we&rsquo;ll take a close look at the culture in Open Source Communities, its status, relevance and why this culture is the key to building the future of OSS. We&rsquo;ll think about the core values of Open Source, amongst them freedom, democracy and decentralization, take a look at software-development as an act of representation and find out why diversity (regarding gender, skills, ethnicities and ideas / backgrounds) and user-centered approaches will be core determinants when we want to build a future for Open Source. </p>

            <p>This talk aims to encourage everyone of us to broaden our horizons when it comes to how far we can go collectively with all our Open Source projects when we&rsquo;re thinking about their future, - and it wants to show how widening our communities, aiming for diversity and sustainability will enable us to build this future together.</p>

            <p>The introduction of the Web Audio API has enriched the web landscape enormously. It gives game developers the ability to add precisely timed, high performant sound effects and to create realistic spatialized sound landscapes. For many web developers it is the first time they encounter audio programming which leads to many interesting experiments when the world of web and audio collide. Traditional web developers start to become really interested into audio programming and educate themselves on the topic of synthesizers and audio effects. However, currently there are only few applications that try to create audio production or audio performance environments in the browser. In this talk I want to show how the Web Audio API can be used to create a collaborative music production environment similar to Garageband. Furthermore, I will do a live demonstration of a music performance setup which is inspired by The Glitch Mob&rsquo;s setup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bXNo9MFXnU). Both demos will show how powerful the Web Audio API is and how important the web can become as platform for music production in the future.</p>

          <p>Between Snowden&rsquo;s NSA leaks prompting more secure communication and the rise of cryptocurrencies- software with secure cryptography as a core component is on the rise. Meanwhile, powerful applications written in JavaScript that render their UIs in a web browser are seeing unprecedented growth. However, if you ask most security researchers and developers about secure crypto in the browser, they&rsquo;ll shake their heads skeptically. Reasons for this being: there are a lack of quality crypto primitives written in JavaScript that&rsquo;ve been adequately reviewed and tested, JavaScript yields weak random number generation in all but the most recent HTML5 browsers, and secure key storage is difficult as the idiom du jour of web applications is to store user data on a remote server or in localStorage.</p>

          <p>This talk will explore how Mailpile, a Free / open source email client, is not vulnerable to these security concerns by shifting the attack surface out of the browser while still being a web application with a friendly JSON API. The gain being developers can leverage modern JavaScript libraries to render beautiful interfaces, animate fresh user interactions, and create compelling data visualziations.

            <p>We say things like &ldquo;don&rsquo;t block the event loop&rdquo;, &ldquo;make sure your code runs at 60 frames-per-second&rdquo;, &ldquo;well of course, it won&rsquo;t work, that function is an asynchronous callback!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you nod and agree, as if it&rsquo;s all obvious, even though you don&rsquo;t actually know what the words mean; and yet, finding good explanations of how JavaScript actually <em>works</em> isn&rsquo;t all that easy, so let&rsquo;s learn!</p>

            <p>With some handy visualisations, and fun hacks, let&rsquo;s get an intuitive understanding of what happens when JavaScript runs.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie - building front end JavaScript applications can be hard. Why? Because state, that&rsquo;s why.</p>

            <p>When writing code for the client, we are almost entirely interested in how to best structure a would be mess of events and state. As our code base grows and the number of possible states increases, if we aren&rsquo;t careful we can end up in the fetal position, alone and questioning our life choices.</p>

            <p>In this talk we will take a look at some of the patterns we see being commonly applied in client app&rsquo;s to see if the give us ways of handling state and state transition in a scaleable, maintainable fashion. Then we will take a look at some tactics you can use to help you better embrace both state and events, without sacrificing clarity in your architecture.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>Mainstream operating systems are bound by abstractions and design decisions largely made decades ago. Modern event-driven software doesn&rsquo;t have a choice but to use less-efficient kernel interfaces. Internet growth brings new challenges for server software and kernel developers. These days we need to handle millions connections and packets per second. This talk tries to answer the questions: how can we optimize JavaScript server software stack to prepare it for such a high loads? And how does JavaScript kernel look like? I&rsquo;ll also show Runtime.JS system that tries to rethink kernel design to improve security, reliability and performance of the system.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, says that the languages we speak influence the way we think. I argue that this applies to programming languages as well. However, key differences between spoken languages and programming languages enable us to adapt and shift our ways of thinking more fluidly as we learn new programming languages than as we learn new spoken languages. It is these same differences that we can and should leverage to both grow individually as programmers and further advance our favorite programming languages. JavaScript is in a particularly ripe place to take advantage of these differences, as it is such a popular and dynamic (literally) language with a strong culture of libraries, evolution, ease of learning, and community.</p>

            <p>Firefox OS is marketed as an OS for mobile phones. Cool. But what if we do one step back and omit the UI layer. Then a Firefox OS phone is a handset that&rsquo;s cheaper (25$) than a bare-bone Raspberry Pi, that includes a ton of sensors, GPS, network connectivity, a battery and a screen. And on top of that it&rsquo;s running the Gecko render engine that has APIs to access all that goodness. It&rsquo;s time to take some phones apart, start hacking and roll our own OS on top of Gecko. Internet of things FTW!</p>

            <p>What about a Firefox OS based doorbell system over bluetooth? A jacket tracker with GPS in case you go out and your jacket gets jacked? A small device that tracks how much you drink during a party? Home surveillance using a network of phones and a bluetooth speaker for an alarm? In this session we&rsquo;ll see some crazy hacks, and you&rsquo;ll should be all set to start hacking yourself!</p>

          <p><time>17:45</time> Back Track</p>
          <div class="description">
            <p>Everyone knows that Web Components are the future, right? Or maybe you think that a well-written Angular directive has everything you need. Or, perhaps, you think that there&rsquo;s no such thing as a well-written Angular directive and so you&rsquo;ll stick with your Ember components thank-you-very-much. Then again, once your brain is thinking in React, why would you use anything else?</p>

            <p>This talk is about the reality of component-based web development, told through the frivolous pursuit of a more awesome IMG tag for animated GIFs. It&rsquo;s a not-so-serious window into a terribly important debate about better encapsulation, reuse, and happiness in our front-end lives.</p>

            <p>We&rsquo;ll talk about:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The surprisingly complicated logic involved breaking apart and manipulating GIFs</li>
              <li>Our ideal Component and how it beautifully hides this complexity</li>
              <li>The different goals, abstractions and constraints of Polymer, Angular, Ember and React</li>
              <li>The challenges involved in trying to write a component compatible with all of them</li>
              <li>What the future of developing reusable components might look like</li>
            </ul>

            <p>GIFs have been a part of the Web since the very beginning, and epitomise the beauty of a simple interface for a powerful, flexible component. What better test for the imminent future of the web than to see how it tackles its past?</p>

            <p>California ideology has undoubtedly changed the way the world looks at technology and business. Silicon Valley has spawned its own stepchildren in Europe like &ldquo;Silicon Allee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Silicon Roundabout&rdquo;. Lately, Silicon Valley has come under criticism for its ethics, social irresponsibility, hyper-capitalistic values, and spending millions of dollars funding apps like &ldquo;Yo&rdquo;. How did we get here?</p>

            <p>My talk will give a brief history of Silicon Valley so we can learn from the past and create a new future. What can we learn from its roots in the LSD-dropping, commune-living hippies that set out to decentralize power and empower the individual?</p>
