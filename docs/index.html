            <p>This talk is about hierarchies: as CSS hurtles toward being object- and systems-oriented, the titles and responsibilities of designer and developer become much more fluid and yet, we continue to categorise. We draw lines between front and back end, between CSS and Javascript (&ldquo;CSS isn&rsquo;t _real_ development&rdquo;), and even between CSS disciplines, but why? Furthermore, we implicitly draw these lines between white male developers and everyone else. This results in damaging hierarchies that threaten to devalue the work we do in diversifying CSS — both as a language and as a community.</p>

            <p>To render a webpage browsers needs to go through the complex dance of networking, parsing and painting before any content can be displayed to your user. Over the years, we've developed mechanisms and hacks to aid the browser at each stage of this process, but these have always come at some cost or trade-off.</p>
            <p>How can we utilize modern web platform features to load our CSS as fast as possible? Should we still be inlining our critical content into the document or instead, how can HTTP/2 server push and Service Workers help us? </p>
            <p>In this talk we will take a journey exploring the current, past, and future best-practices for loading CSS in the browser and how we can achieve a first meaningful paint within 1000ms. Ultimately creating a faster, more resilient experience for our users.</p>

            <p>Ever thought about localising your site, but realised it led to a lot of messy duplication? Do you want to re-use component styles, but have some styles overwrite others due to that cascade? Not sure where to start with CSS architecture?</p>
            <p>In this talk, you'll learn how to get started with your own lightweight, localised CSS setup. We'll go through how we use Grandstand, a CSS framework built by BBC Sport, as the scaffolding for our CSS. Starting with bare bones of just ~10kb, it has the flexibility to allow layouts in 10 scripts for 20+ languages, and we&rsquo;re using it across the BBC News &amp; Sport sites.</p>

            <p>Understanding how CSS is developed is more than an academic exercise. It gives you a way of understanding why things are weird, which is a good starting point to avoiding or fixing weirdness. It can give you an early heads up as to what might be happening in the very near future. It also opens up an opportunity to be part of the process, to contribute to CSS - just like any open source project. Then once we have new CSS on the horizon, we can all be part of encouraging browser vendors to ship it!</p>

            <p>As user interfaces evolve and become more interactive, design requirements become more complex. By combining CSS variables with reactive programming in JS, we can now express animations, styles, layout, and more in ways never before possible with CSS. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll explore what functional reactive programming is, why it is incredibly useful, and how we can leverage the power of CSS variables to push the limits of styling the web.</p>

            <p> Data sketches is a collaboration between Nadieh and Shirley, where they choose a topic and visualize it by the end of the month. The collaboration started for many reasons: they weren&rsquo;t creating as many personal data visualization projects, so they were looking for the motivation to make more. They wanted to explore their creativity, to experiment with the tools that are out there, to learn from each other, and to have fun.</p>
            <p>In this talk, Shirley and Nadieh will share the lessons they learned while working on data sketches. They will highlight their favorite months of data, sketches, and code: what made them their favorites, the mistakes made along the way, and how they overcame them. They hope that by sharing their visualizations&rsquo; humble, ugly duckling beginnings and their many (embarrassing) iterations, that it will inspire others to create their own unique and compelling visualizations. </p>

            <p> In the past few years, we&rsquo;ve witnessed a massive increase in the amount of CSS experimentation, with ideas like CSS Modules and—most controversially—the rise of CSS-in-JS. But does mixing our styles and logic run counter to the original ideas of CSS? Does it break progressive enhancement?</p>
            <p>In this talk, we&rsquo;ll take an empathetic look at these new approaches, how they relate to the history of CSS, and why they might possibly hold the key to the future of CSS—all from the point-of-view of someone who has been writing CSS since 1999. </p>

            <p>Building user interfaces on the web is hard, because the web, and thus CSS, was inherently made for documents. Because UIs fundamentally are not documents, we've seen a mindset shift towards building component-based system.</p>
            <p>The rise of JavaScript frameworks like React, Ember and recently Angular 2, the effort of the W3C to standardize a web-native component system, pattern libraries and styleguides being considered 'the right way to build web applications' and many other things have illuminated this revolution – we are now in the "Component Age".</p>
            <p>With that and a few more things in mind, Max along with Glen Maddern (co-creator of css-modules) sat down and started thinking about styling in this new era. They took the best of CSS and the Web to build a new way to style component-based systems. In this talk, Max will describe what they thought about and why they arrived where they did –

            <p>Just how different was the development experience then compared to now? Is it feasible to implement a modern Web application in the browser that pioneered client-side development? What would code from 1995 look like rewritten with today’s JavaScript?</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>Functional programming has been gaining a lot of popularity in the JS community, and with good reason: rejecting side-effects and mutability - in-place changes to data - helps avoid a lot of headaches. But when you refuse to mutate objects, you have to create a whole new object each time something changes, which can slow things down and eat up memory, making functional programming seem inefficient.</p>
            <p>That’s where immutable data structures come in - to save the day, and time and space! Also called “persistent data structures”, they help you efficiently make new “modified” versions of immutable objects, by reusing parts of the old object that you don’t need to change.</p>
            <p>In this talk we’ll take a look at how these data structures work, why they’re fantastic for functional programming, and how we can easily use them in our JS code thanks to libraries like Mori and Immutable.js.</p>

            <p>In 2016, we at The Financial Times launched a new version of our website to great success. It broke ground on key areas in which we’d set out to excel and measured very closely, like performance, resilience and usability. But one day, and rather serendipitously, we realized we had largely forgotten to measure one thing: accessibility. And you can’t improve what you don’t measure.</p>

            <p>Breaking the API of a package can create severe disruptions downstream, but package maintainers have flexibility in whether and how to perform a change. Through interviews and a survey, we found that developers within a community or platform often share cohesive practices (e.g., semver, backporting, synchronized releases), but that those practices differ from community to community, and that most developers are not aware of alternative strategies and practices, their tradeoffs, and why other communities adopt them. Most interestingly, it seems that often practices and community consensus seems to be driven by implicit values in each community, such as stability, rapid access, or ease to contribute. Understanding and discussing values openly can help to understand and resolve conflicts, such as discussions between demands for more stability and a pursuit of frequent and disruptive innovations.</p>

            <p>Today’s most popular frameworks come from a time when the world was a different place. Ember’s first rendering engine, for example, was optimized around the performance gotchas of Internet Explorer 6. IE6 has since faded into history, and smartphones with spotty connectivity and occasionally dodgy hardware have become the lowest common denominator that we must optimize for.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we’ll discuss how smartphones fundamentally change the assumptions we make about architecting applications for the web. Then, we’ll cover how we can embrace these new mobile constraints to build even better apps—for everyone. Finally, we’ll look at the techniques used by desktop-era libraries and what they’re doing to become great for the mobile web.</p>

            <p>The early 2000s bred a new generation of web developers and designers out of the pure need of creative expression. Teens didn’t have access to StackOverflow, and couldn’t easily Google their coding problems—so they turned to each other. Through collaboration and inspiration from others that were blazing their own way, they created their own unique personal sites without any regard for standards. Let’s explore the world of CSS via ‘filter: dropshadow’, JavaScript snippets, 8 pixel fonts and take a look back at what the web looked like before we followed the rules.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is notoriously bad when it comes to date and time problems. The built-in Date object has so many quirks and implementation differences that many developers have abandoned it, in favor of libraries. How did we get here, and what can be done about this? This talk is in three parts, and led by maintainers of the Moment.js library. First, you’ll understand how the Date object came to be, what parts of it are useful, and where the problems are. Next, you’ll learn about the present-day alternatives. We’ll cover three modern JavaScript libraries: Moment, date-fns, and js-joda, all of which are viable solutions. Lastly, you’ll hear about how we are working through the ECMAScript technical committee to get better support for dates, times and time zones built-in to the language.</p>

            <p>In a few months time, I had created a new calendar for our partners at Booking.com. Months? Yes, months. Creating a calendar that works correctly all across the world for 42 different languages and even more locales, is not something that you do in a week. In this talk I will talk to you about the weird things I learned. From Brazilian Summer Time and Slovakian date formatting, to surprises in open-sources libraries and dealing with wrong assumptions. And how to avoid the many (many!) mistakes I made.</p>

            <p>Early look in to the upcoming JavaScript features SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics. I will show you, how to craft complex applications using shared memory and gain massive performance boost by utilizing all available CPU cores for parallel computation on same data. I will also teach you how to write safe code while using shared memory and avoiding deadlocks of web workers. I will introduce a custom TypeScript like language called TurboScript for easy parallel programming which will generate efficient asm.js like JavaScript. Finally I will do a live demo of an app created using shared memory and TurboScript “A Global Illumination Ray Tracing Renderer for Three.js”</p>

            <p>August 30, 2016, was by all accounts an average Tuesday, and release number 523 just a simple re-factor, but something went horribly wrong that day: bad code escaped from the office, and it quickly spread to infect tens of thousands, giving rise to a hoard of zombie ServiceWorkers!</p>
            <p>This is a disaster about a typo. This is a thriller about technology out of control. This is a tragedy about wasted CPU cycles. This is a cautionary tale about living in the age of ServiceWorker.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) was a technology introduced by Netscape in 1996. Chances are, you’ve never heard of JSSS, since it was available in Netscape Communicator 4.0. They allowed you to define custom styling rules for your web pages. You’re probably more familiar with its competitor at the time—CSS. They were pretty cool though. JSSS allowed the developer to style the DOM using a full programming language with variables, conditionals, and functions.</p>
            <p>The obvious spoiler alert here is that CSS won and JSSS lost, right? It’s not that simple. A lot of the ideas from JSSS have slowly been creeping back into our toolset. SASS brought programming logic back into styling our applications. CSS picked up variables and the ability to do calculations. Finally, the React community has been—maybe unknowingly—bringing JSSS back from the dead. In this talk, we’ll take a good hard look at JSSS and the ways in which JSSS has had enduring legacy after its untimely demise.</p>
